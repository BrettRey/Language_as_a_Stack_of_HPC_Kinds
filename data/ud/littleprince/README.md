# Summary
This treebank contains manually corrected Universal Dependency annotations for 500 sentences from the English translation of *The Little Prince*.

# Introduction
This treebank is based on the English translation of *The Little Prince* and consists of a subset of **500 sentences** (validated manually). The project was undertaken by students in the 11-422 Grammar Formalisms course at Carnegie Mellon University, taught by Prof. Lori Levin, with the aim of practicing dependency parsing and analyzing linguistic structures. We used silver parses from the [English Little Prince SNACS corpus](https://github.com/nert-nlp/English-Little-Prince-SNACS) (v1.0) as a base (these were the output of the Stanza parser). We sampled 500 of these sentences and manually corrected them using ArboratorGrew for easy editing. Two annotators worked on each sentence, with approximately 25% of the sentences checked by the course coordinator. The annotations follow the Universal Dependencies guidelines and have been validated for correctness and consistency.

# Acknowledgments
We would like to thank Georgetown for providing the initial silver parse of *The Little Prince*. We also thank Prof. Lori Levin for supervising this project and the students of 11-422 Grammar Formalisms for their dedicated work on this treebank. This project is also part of the course's broader effort to practice syntactic theory and Universal Dependencies annotation.
